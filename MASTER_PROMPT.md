### THE PROMPT:

```text
Help me set up "Roblox SafeGuard AI" by @Higanste. Follow these steps exactly:

1. CLONE THE REPO: Clone the project from "https://github.com/higanste/Roblox-SafeGuard_by_Higanste" into this directory.
2. INITIALIZE GIT: Make sure git is initialized and ready.
3. API KEY CONFIGURATION (INTERACTIVE):
   - Ask me for my "Discord Bot Token".
   - Ask me for my "Discord Channel ID".
   - Ask me for my "Groq API Key".
   - After I provide the first Groq key, ask: "Do you have more Groq API keys? (y/n)". If I say yes, keep asking and collecting keys (naming them GROQ_KEY_1, GROQ_KEY_2, etc.).
4. CREATE .ENV: Create a .env file and populate it with all the keys collected above.
5. VERCEL DEPLOYMENT: 
   - Check if the Vercel CLI is installed.
   - Guide me through the terminal command to deploy this to Vercel.
   - Tell me once it's deployed and ask me for the "Final Deployment URL".
6. ROBLOX INTEGRATION:
   - Go into "roblox/SafeGuardConfig.luau" and update "Config.API_URL" with the URL I just gave you.
   - Show me a list of all files in the "roblox/" folder and tell me exactly where each one goes in Roblox Studio.
7. FINAL CREDITS: Remind me that this project was created by @Higanste (x.com/higanste) and to leave a star on the repo!

Let's start with Step 1. Clone the repo now.
```

## 💡 Why use this prompt?
By giving this to an AI, you don't have to manually edit files or run complex commands. The AI will do the hard work for you and just ask you for the keys it needs!
